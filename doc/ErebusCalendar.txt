Description of the Calendar Tree in Erebus
==========================================

The Calendar is a tree of CNodes, corresponding to the following
structure:

- calendar
  - timezone
    - name
    - id
    - recurrence
    - range
  - event
    - ...
    - tzid

The structure is inspired by the structure in Exchange Web Services
and iCalendar. Timezones are stored outside of the events, like
iCalendar, but the representation is more like EWS (because it's a
*lot* simpler than iCalendar's).

See the conversion visitors (especially EWS2ErebusVisitor) for more
details.
