Erebus clients
==============

Erebus have been tested mostly with Mozilla Sunbird, but should
of course work well with any decent CalDAV client.

Sunbird
-------
Note: Support for CalDAV in Mozilla Sunbird v0.7 is horrible, so you
should run Sunbird v0.9 instead. As of writing, I'm running Sunbird
0.9pre, which is quite well-behaving.
