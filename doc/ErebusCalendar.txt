Description of the Calendar Tree in Erebus
==========================================

The Calendar is a tree of CNodes, corresponding to the following
structure:

- calendar
  - timezone
    - name
    - id
    - recurrence
    - range
  - event
    - ...
    - tzid

The structure is inspired by the structure in Exchange Web Services
and iCalendar. In general, iCalendar conventions are kept. However,
the timezones are in EWS format (because that's a *lot* simpler).

When the timezones get imported, their ids (if they exist) are thrown
away, and they get a sha1 sum as the new id. This approach is not
perfect, but it greatly simplifies equivalence testing of timezones.

See the conversion visitors (especially EWS2ErebusVisitor) for more
details.
