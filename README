Erebus
======

This is the Erebus Exchange CalDAV Connector. 

Current status
--------------

- Basic WebDAV support with a Microsoft Exchange 2007 SP1 server
  supported (GET/PUT).
- Still some problems with timezone conversion between iCalendar and
  Exchange.

Dependencies
------------
- Python 2.4
- iCalendar, http://codespeak.net/icalendar/

Usage
-----

You need to create the file 'localpw.py', containing:

host     = <your exchange 2007 server>
username = <your username>
password = <your password>

username and password aren't strictly necessary, but you need them to
run some of the scripts in utils/.

Run the webdav server with

$ python pydav-serve.py
